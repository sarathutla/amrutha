<!-- PROBLEM / MARKET GAP -->
<section class="problem reveal">
  <div class="container split">
    <div>
      <h2>The Choice Most Families Are Left With</h2>

      <p>
        Most households today choose between two imperfect options.
        Well-known brands look premium, but often charge more for
        marketing than for the grain itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Local alternatives may be affordable, but consistency and
        transparency are hard to trust. Over time, customers are left
        adjusting — rather than choosing with confidence.

<!-- OUR SOLUTION -->

  <div class="container">
    <h2>A Simpler, More Honest Way</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      We believe quality comes from owning the essentials —
      and keeping everything else simple.
    </p>

    <div class="features">
      <div class="feature" data-stagger>
        <h3>Known Farmers</h3>
        <p>
          We source rice from farmers we work with directly,
          building long-term relationships instead of anonymous supply.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature" data-stagger>
        <h3>Our Own Rice Mill</h3>
        <p>
          Processing happens within our own mill, allowing us to
          make decisions without external pressure or shortcuts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature" data-stagger>
        <h3>No Middlemen</h3>
        <p>
          By removing unnecessary layers, we stay closer to the
          product and closer to the people who consume it.

    <!-- WHY SINGLE POLISHED RICE -->
<section class="single-polished reveal">
  <div class="container split reverse">
    <div>
      <h2>Why We Choose Single Polished Rice</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Single polishing is a conscious balance — retaining more of the 
        grain’s natural layers without compromising everyday cooking
        and taste.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike fully polished rice, single polished rice is processed 
        gently, leaving more of the grain intact rather than stripping 
        it down completely.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach keeps the rice closer to its natural form while 
        still ensuring it cooks well and fits comfortably into regular meals.
      </p>
