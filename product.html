<!-- What is Single Polished Rice -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What is Single Polished Rice?</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      Single polished rice undergoes minimal surface polishing, unlike fully polished rice
      which is repeatedly processed for appearance.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Minimal Processing</h3>
        <p>
          After milling, the rice is polished only once to remove excess bran while
          retaining more of the grain’s natural nutrients and structure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Balanced Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Single polishing offers a balance between nutrition and cooking quality,
          making it suitable for regular Indian meals.
