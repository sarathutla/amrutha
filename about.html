<!-- Brand Story -->

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      In a market increasingly dominated by over-processing and appearance-driven products,
      Amrutha takes a thoughtful, quality-first approach to rice.
    </p>

        <h3>Why Amrutha</h3>
        <p>
          We observed a growing gap between visually polished rice and nutritionally sensible rice.
          While excessive polishing improves appearance, it often comes at the cost of essential nutrients.
          Amrutha was born to address this gap through carefully processed single polished rice.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Focused on Everyday India</h3>
        <p>
          Our products are designed for real Indian kitchens — where taste, texture, digestion,
          and consistency matter more than shine. Whether it is daily household cooking or institutional use,
          Amrutha aims to deliver dependable quality.

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      Every decision at Amrutha is guided by long-term thinking, transparency and respect
      for the food we consume every day.

    <div class="grid grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Minimal Processing</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that food should be processed only as much as necessary.
          Single polishing helps retain more of the grain’s natural properties
          while maintaining excellent cooking quality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Consistency Over Shortcuts</h3>
        <p>
          From sourcing to packaging, we focus on repeatable processes and quality checks
          to ensure that every batch of Amrutha rice meets the same standards.
